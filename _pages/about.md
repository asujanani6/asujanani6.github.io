I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Combinatorics and Optimization at University of Waterloo where I am advised by Stephen Vavasis, Henry Wolkowicz, and Walaa Moursi from C&O and Saeed Ghadimi from MS&E. I am interested broadly in continuous optimization, semidefinite programming, scientific computing, and efficient numerical methods for optimization. The main focus of my research is to develop scalable, fast, and parameter-free first order-methods for large-scale optimization.

Previosuly, I received my PhD in Operations Research in Summer 2024 from Georgia Tech ISyE where I was advised by Renato D.C. Monteiro. I also received my M.S. in Mathematics in Spring 2024 from Georgia Tech and a B.S. in Applied and Computational Mathematics in Spring 2019 from University of Southern California.
