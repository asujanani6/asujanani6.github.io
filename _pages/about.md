I am a postdoctoral researcher at University of Waterloo's [Department of Combinatorics and Optimization](https://uwaterloo.ca/combinatorics-and-optimization/) where I am advised by [Stephen Vavasis](https://uwaterloo.ca/scholar/vavasis/home), [Henry Wolkowicz](https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~hwolkowi/), and [Walaa Moursi](https://sites.google.com/view/walaa-moursi/home) from C&O and [Saeed Ghadimi](https://sites.google.com/view/sghadimi/home) from MS&E. I am interested broadly in continuous optimization, semidefinite programming, scientific computing, and efficient numerical methods for optimization. The main focus of my research is to develop scalable, fast, and parameter-free first order-methods for large-scale optimization.

Previously, I received my PhD in Operations Research in Summer 2024 from Georgia Tech ISyE where I was advised by Renato D.C. Monteiro. I also received my M.S. in Mathematics in Spring 2024 from Georgia Tech and a B.S. in Applied and Computational Mathematics in Spring 2019 from University of Southern California.
