I am a postdoctoral fellow at University of Waterloo's [Department of Combinatorics and Optimization](https://uwaterloo.ca/combinatorics-and-optimization/) where I am advised by [Henry Wolkowicz](https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~hwolkowi/) (24-26), [Saeed Ghadimi](https://sites.google.com/view/sghadimi/home) (24-26), [Walaa Moursi](https://sites.google.com/view/walaa-moursi/home) (24-26), and [Stephen Vavasis](https://uwaterloo.ca/scholar/vavasis/home) (24-25). I am interested broadly in optimization for machine learning, continuous optimization, semidefinite programming, scientific computing, and numerical linear algebra. The main focus of my research is to develop scalable, fast, and parameter-free first order-methods for large-scale optimization problems, particularly those arising in machine learning and data science.

Previously, I received my PhD in Operations Research in Summer 2024 from [Georgia Tech ISyE](https://www.isye.gatech.edu) where I was advised by [Renato D.C. Monteiro](https://sites.gatech.edu/renato-monteiro/). I also received my M.S. in Mathematics in Spring 2024 from Georgia Tech and a B.S. in Applied and Computational Mathematics in Spring 2019 from University of Southern California.
