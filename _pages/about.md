I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Combinatorics and Optimization at University of Waterloo where I am advised by Stephen Vavasis, Henry Wolkowicz, and Walaa Moursi from C&O and Saeed Ghadimi from MS&E. I am interested broadly in continuous optimization, semidefinite programming, scientific computing, and numerical methods for optimization. The main focus of my research is to develop scalable, fast, and parameter-free first order-methods for large-scale optimization.

Previosuly, I received my PhD in Operations from Georgia Tech ISyE where I was advised by Renato D.C. Monteiro.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
